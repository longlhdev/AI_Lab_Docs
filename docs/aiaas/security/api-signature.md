# API Signature

## What is API Signature?

API Signature is a mechanism to validate and secure API requests. It ensures that each request is authentic, non-replayable, and authorized by a verified client.

By using API Signature, Apero AI Lab protects its AI services from unauthorized access, forged requests, and abuseâ€”particularly important when working with high-performance AI operations such as content generation, enhancement, and sensitive data analysis.

All AIaaS services provided by **Apero AI Lab** enforce API Signature as a **mandatory** security mechanism to enhance protection at scale.
